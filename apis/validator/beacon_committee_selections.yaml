  summary: Determine if a distributed validator has been selected to aggregate attestations
  description: |
    This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as part of a distributed validator cluster, and is 
    implemented by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is used to exchange partial 
    selection proofs for combined/aggregated selection proofs to allow a validator client 
    to correctly determine if any of its validators has been selected to perform an attestation aggregation duty in a slot. 
    Validator clients running in a distributed validator cluster must query this endpoint at the start of an epoch for the current and lookahead (next) epochs for
    all validators that have attester duties in the current and lookahead epochs. Consensus clients need not support this
    endpoint and may return a 501.
